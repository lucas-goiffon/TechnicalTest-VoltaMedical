# Technical Test for Volta Medical

The goal of this project is to create a clock app with alarms using Electron.

More details about the technologies:
- [x] Electron
- [x] React / Typescript Frontend
- [x] Fonctional Component
- [x] Alarms persistence with SQLite

Steps:
- [x] Create a first Electron App
- [x] Open a window
- [ ] Containerize with Docker?
- [x] Use ReactJS
- [x] Do a basic frontend design
- [x] Link with database
- [x] Improve frontend

Note that I'll probably not do the Docker part because I know from experience how painful it can sometimes be to open a window from a container.

## How to install

You must have at least NodeJS 18 installed.

Just clone this repository and run: ````npm install````.

## How to use

To run this project and test it, you have to execute the following command: ````npm start````.

## Notes

After discovering Electron, which by the way is fast to understand, the question was: what is the best way to integrate React?
So I did my researches, I found several boilerplates, and I choosed [this one](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate) because of it's simplicity.

I'm used to FormBuilders but, as there was only one very basic form, I didn't take the time to search about it.

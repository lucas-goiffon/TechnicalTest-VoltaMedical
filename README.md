# Technical Test for Volta Medical

The goal of this project is to create a clock app with alarms using Electron.

More details about the technologies:
- [x] Electron
- [ ] React / Typescript Frontend
- [ ] Fonctional Component
- [ ] Alarms persistence with SQLite

Steps:
- [x] Create a first Electron App
- [x] Open a window
- [ ] Containerize with Docker?
- [ ] Use ReactJS
- [ ] Do a basic frontend design
- [ ] Link with database
- [ ] Improve frontend

Note that I'll probably not do the Docker part because I know from experience how painful it can sometimes be to open a window from a container.
